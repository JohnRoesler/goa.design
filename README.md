# goa.design

This repository contains the source code of [http://goa.design](http://goa.design). The site is
a static website built using [hugo](http://gohugo.io) and served from Google Cloud Storage.

## Contributing

Is that typo bugging you? us too! If you want to do something about it:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repo
2. Open a terminal and run `make` inside the repo.

`make` starts a server on your box that "liveloads" all changes you make to the content (that is
the page should refresh itself each time you save a content page).

3. Edit the content in the `/content` directory.
4. Submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

## Deployment

After a commit is pushed to the master branch the [TravisCI job](https://travis-ci.org/goadesign/goa.design)
does the following:

1. It clones the [goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa), [middleware](https://github.com/goadesign/middleware)
   and [encoding](https://github.com/goadesign/encoding) repositories in a temporary directory.
2. It runs a modified version of [godoc2md](https://github.com/davecheney/godoc2md) to produce
   Markdown files from the sources. The modified version also adds anchors to each title.
3. It runs hugo which produces the HTML from the markdown files (both the static markdown files
   and the ones generated by `godoc2md`).
4. It pushes the results to [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).
