# The goa Design Language

The goa API Design Language is a DSL implemented in [Go](https://golang.org) that makes it possible
to describe arbitrary microservice APIs. While the main focus is REST based HTTP APIs the language
is flexible enough to describe other APIs as well. [Plugins](../extend/plugins.md) can extend the
core DSL to allow describing other aspects of microservices such as database models, service
discovery integrations, failure handlers etc.

At its core the design language consists of functions that are chained together to describe
*definitions*. The goa design language root definition is the API definition, the DSL to define it
looks like this:
```go
import (
        . "github.com/goadesign/goa/design"
        . "github.com/goadesign/goa/design/apidsl"
)

var _ = API("My API", func() {                           // "My API" is the name of the API used in docs
	Title("Documentation title")                     // Documentation title
	Description("The next big thing")                // Longer documentation description
	Host("goa.design")				 // Host used by Swagger and clients
	Scheme("https")					 // HTTP scheme used by Swagger and clients
	BasePath("/api")				 // Base path to all API endpoints
	Consumes("application/json", "application/xml")  // Media types supported by the API
	Produces("application/json")                     // Media types generated by the API
})
```
There are more language keywords (functions) supported by the API DSL listed in the
[reference](../reference/goa/design.html).

*A side note on "dot import" as this question comes up often: the goa API design language is a DSL
implemented in Go and is __not__ Go. The generated code or any of the actual Go code in goa does
not make use of "dot imports". Using this technique for the DSL results in far cleaner looking
code. It also allows mixing DSLs coming from plugins transparently, moving on...*

Apart from the root API definition the goa API design language also makes it possible to describe
the actual endpoints together with details on the shape of the requests and responses. The
`Resource` function defines a set of related API endpoints - a resource if the API is RESTful. Each
actual endpoint is described using the `Action` function. Here is an example of a simple `Operands`
resource exposing a `add` action (API endpoint):
```go
var _ = Resource("Operands", func() {                            // Define the Operands resource
        Action("add", func() {                                   // Define the add action
                Routing(GET("/add/:left/:right"))                 // The relative path to the add endpoint
                Description("add returns the sum of the left and right parameters in the response body")
                Params(func() {                                  // Define the request parameters found in the URI (wildcards)
                        Param("left", Integer, "Left operand")   // Define left parameter as path segment captured by :left
                        Param("right", Integer, "Right operand") // Define right parameter as path segment captured by :right
                })
                Response(OK, "plain/text")                       // Define response
        })
})
```
The `Resource` and `Action` DSLs support many more keywords described in the [reference](../reference/goa/design).

The goa API design language also makes it possible to describe arbitrary data types that the API
uses both in its request payloads and response media types. Looking first at request payloads: the
`Type` function describes a data structure by listing each field using the `Attribute` function. It
can also make use of the `ArrayOf` function to define arrays or fields that are arrays. Here is what
it looks like:
```go
// Operand describes a single operand with a name and an integer value.
var Operand = Type("Operand", func() {
	Attribute("name", String, "Operand name")
	Attribute("value", Integer, "Operand value")
})

// Series represents an array of operands.
var Series = ArrayOf(Operand)
```
These types can be used to define an action payload (amongst other things):
```go
        Action("sum", func() {              // Define the sum action
                Routing(POST("/sum"))        // The relative path to the add endpoint
                Description("sum returns the sum of all the operands in the response body")
		Payload(Series)             // Payload defines the action request body shape.
                Response(OK, "plain/text")  // Define response
        })
```
Looking at responses next, the goa design language `MediaType` function describes media types which
represent the shape of response bodies. The definition of a media types is similar to the definition
of types (media types are a specialized kind of type) however there are two properties unique to
media types:

* Views make it possible to describe different renderings of the same media type. Often times an API
  uses a "short" representation of a resource in listing requests and a more detailed representation
  in requests that return a single resource. Views cover that use case by providing a way to define
  these different representations. A media type definition *must* define the default view used to
  render the resources.
* The other media type specific property is links. Links represent related resources that should be
  rendered embedded in the response. The view used to render links is `link` which means that
  media types being linked to must define a `link` view.
