## What is goa?

goa is a Go framework for writing microservices that promotes best practice by
providing a single source of truth from which server code, client code, and
documentation is derived. The code generated by goa follows the clean
architecture pattern where composable modules are generated for the transport,
endpoint, and business logic layers. The goa package contains middleware,
plugins, and other complementary functionality that can be leveraged in tandem
with the generated code to implement complete microservices in an efficient
manner. By using goa for developing microservices, implementers don't have to
worry with the documentation getting out of sync from the implementation as goa
takes care of generating OpenAPI specifications for HTTP based services and gRPC
protocol buffer files for gRPC based services (or both if the service supports
both transports). Reviewers can also be assured that the implementation follows
the documentation as the code is generated from the same source.

## How is goa v2 different from v1?

* goa v2 is **composable**. The package, code generation algorithms, and
  generated code are all more modular and make fewer assumptions than goa v1
  did.
* A microservice designed by goa v2 is **transport-agnostic**. The decoupling of
  transport layer from the actual service implementation means that the same
  service can expose endpoints accessible via multiple transports such as HTTP
  and/or gRPC. goa v2 takes care of generating all the transport-specific code
  including encoding, decoding, and validating requests and responses. goa v1
  produces code for HTTP transport only.
* goa v2 generated code follows a **strict separation of concern** where the
  actual service implmentation is isolated from the transport code. User code
  only has to focus on the actual service method implementations.
* goa v2 generates code that **relies mostly on Go standard library types**
  making it easier to interface with external code.
* DSLs in goa v2 can be used to generate [**gRPC service definition** using
  protocol
  buffers](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#service-definition).  The
  code generator compiles the generated service definition using the [protocol
  buffer
  compiler](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#generating)
  with the gRPC plugin and generates a Go file consisting of protocol buffer
  types, gRPC server, and client code. goa uses the [proto3 syntax](
  https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) for generating
  gRPC service definitions.
* goa v2 code generation follows a two-phase process where the first phase
  produces a set of writers each exposing templates that can be further modified
  before running the last phase which generates the final artifacts. This makes
  it possible for [**plugins**](/v2/plugins) to alter the code generated by the
  built-in code generators.
